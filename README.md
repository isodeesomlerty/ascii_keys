# Keys - ASCII Code Fetcher Game

`Keys` is a simple interactive Python application that displays the ASCII code of the key pressed by the user. It is built using the `pygame` library, which is commonly used for creating games and multimedia applications in Python.

## Description

Upon running the game, a window is displayed with the instruction "Press a key to get its ASCII code:". When the user presses a key, its ASCII code is displayed in the center of the window. The game runs in an infinite loop until the user closes the window.
