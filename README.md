# Keys - ASCII Code Fetcher Game

`Keys` is a simple interactive Python application that displays the ASCII code of the key pressed by the user. It is built using the `pygame` library, which is commonly used for creating games and multimedia applications in Python.

## Description

Upon running the game, a window is displayed with the instruction "Press a key to get its ASCII code:". When the user presses a key, its ASCII code is displayed in the center of the window. The game runs in an infinite loop until the user closes the window.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.x on your computer.
- You have installed `pygame`. If you haven't installed `pygame` yet, you can do so using pip: pip install pygame.

## Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the folder containing the `keys.py` file in your terminal and run: python keys.py.


## How to Play

- Simply press any key on your keyboard to see its corresponding ASCII code.
- To exit the game, close the window.
